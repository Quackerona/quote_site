"What's the quote of 10 minutes" is a fun little side project made to learn Rust. You can submit a line and it will be shared globally! (That is, if you're quick enough).
A line can be submitted **BY ONE PERSON** every 10 minutes, so be quick if you want to be heard!

>[!WARNING]
>No censoring is implemented, as this is only a small side project.
